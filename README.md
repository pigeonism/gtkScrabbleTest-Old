# gtkScrabbleTest-Old

I created this training game to help learn gtk and c++. It's a training game for scrabble.

To compile it, dependencies are libcanberra (libcanberra-dev), glib-2.0 and libgtk-3-dev. Also because I started with codeblocks i set the compile option to use 'Have g++ follow the C++11 ISO C++ language standard' in compiler settings found in codeblocks build options.

The compiled result needs to be with the 'sounds', 'highscores', 'gameStyle' and 'dictionary' directories, for this I change the project properties> build targets> release field to the source directory.
