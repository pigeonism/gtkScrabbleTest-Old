# gtkScrabbleTest-Old

I created this training game to help learn gtk and c++. It's a training game for scrabble.

To compile it, dependencies are libcanberra (libcanberra-dev), glib-2.0 and libgtk-3-dev. Also because I started with codeblocks i set the compile option to use 'Have g++ follow the C++11 ISO C++ language standard' in compiler settings found in codeblocks build options.
